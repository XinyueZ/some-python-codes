Some codes in Python(3)
===
A bucket for some codes in Python which are written at my free time at home. 
Some of them are from online-lessons, some of them are from my own creations.

# Purpose
No purpose only for fun. Only find that the codes must be saved in somewhere to 
prevent from losing for some special occasions.

# Spotlight

- [http crawl](https://github.com/XinyueZ/some-python-codes/tree/master/advanced_python/http_crawl)
	- A small web-crawl tool to crawl first href-link on wikipedia content. 
		- From a wiki-page to a target page.
		- Can define max continue if target page can not be reached.
- [send SMS](https://github.com/XinyueZ/some-python-codes/tree/master/advanced_python/send_message)
	- Use [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to send SMS.

- [profanity content check](https://github.com/XinyueZ/some-python-codes/tree/master/advanced_python/profanity_check)
	- Use [Google's profanity API](http://www.wdylike.appspot.com/?q=some_content) to check plant text contents.
		- Edit [message.txt](https://github.com/XinyueZ/some-python-codes/blob/master/advanced_python/profanity_check/message.txt), just give some texts freely.
		- Find profanity or embarrassing content.
- [show movie trailer](https://github.com/XinyueZ/some-python-codes/tree/master/advanced_python/movie_trailer_website)
	- Show a website(opening system browser) on local computer with some film trailers
